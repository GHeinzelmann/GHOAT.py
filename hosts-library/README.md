# Library of hosts


The hosts library folder provides all the needed GHOAT input parameters for several host-guest systems, including all the ones from the benchmark set at https://github.com/MobleyLab/benchmarksets [1]. 

Each folder corresponds to a different host, with an explanation on how to use the benchmark data above to perform the calculations in a fully automated way. Other hosts will be added with time, and instructions on how to set a new host are included in section 6 of the User Guide at https://github.com/GHeinzelmann/GHOAT.py/blob/main/doc/User-guide.pdf.
