## Adding alpha-cyclodextrin (aCD) systems to the GHOAT workflow

Here we show how to configure GHOAT.py for guest-host calculations on the aCD host, using the initial coordinates and parameters from the proposed benchmark sets at https://github.com/MobleyLab/benchmarksets [1].

### Partial charges and atom types

The .mol2 files for the aCD host and its proposed guests will provide the partial charges and atom types, and can be found inside the following folder from the benchmarks distribution above:

*benchmarksets-master/input_files/cd-set1/mol2*

Here we use modified versions of these host and guest .mol2 files, so that they are in the correct format for use with GHOAT. We describe the modifications below.

#### Host mol2 file

The modified host file (host-acd.mol2) has only one host residue (MGO), and is already included in the  *hosts-library/aCD/parameters* folder from the GHOAT distribution. The parameters are identical to the ones provided by the benchmarks, obtained from Ref. [2], but they are adjusted so GHOAT can read them and correctly build the systems.


#### Guest mol2 files

The guest .mol2 files also need to be modified in order to match the system parameter (.prmtop) files from [1]. Here the atom types need to be converted to the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) format. This can be done for guest 1 using the *antechamber* program from Ambertools: 

antechamber -i guest-1.mol2 -fi mol2 -o guest-1.mol2 -fo mol2 -s 2 -at gaff -dr no

, and similarly for all other guests. Once in the correct format, the guests and host .mol2 files have to be copied to the *GHOAT/parameters* folder, so they can be used in the binding free energy calculations. Their names should match the host and guest names in the GHOAT input file (see the tutorial).

### Additional files

A few additional files are needed to build the aCD systems, since this host has multiple identical residues and uses parameters from Ref. [2]. They are already included in the *hosts-library/aCD/parameters* and *hosts-library/aCD/amber_files* folders, and should be copied to the *GHOAT/parameters* and *GHOAT/amber_files* folders, respectively.

### Initial structures

The initial coordinates files (.rst7) with full system parameter files (.prmtop) can be found inside the folders

*benchmarksets-master/input_files/cd-set1/prmtop-rst7*

To generate the complex structure file for each guest bound to the aCD host in .pdb format, the *cpptraj* program from Ambertools can be used. Type, inside the prmtop-rst7 folder above:

cpptraj -p acd-1-s.prmtop -y acd-1-s.rst7 -x host-acd-guest-1.pdb > cpptraj.log

, for calculations on the aCD host in complex with guest number 1 in the 's' (secondary) orientation. Copy the generated structure (host-acd-guest-1s.pdb) to the *GHOAT/structures* folder inside the GHOAT package.

### Running the calculations

With the files above and the aCD-specific GHOAT input parameters included in the host-aCD.in file, the calculations can now be performed as shown in the example from the GHOAT.py tutorial. Additional information can be found in the GHOAT tutorial and user guide.
